Hi Pernilla!

I have to admit I got stuck playing the game for an hour before I even looked at the code!

Exceptional work, as you will see below you've ticked all the boxes and clearly show a great understanding of what you are trying to do.

This is a serious coding challenge at any level, very, very well done.

10/10 Välgodkänt!
